There are only two bedrooms and not three... the ""third"" is the lounge / dining room area. We didn't realize this, so it wasn't ideal for our needs in that way. However, looking at the photos, it does show the lounge has fold out mattresses to make it a place to sleep. No  chairs with legs in the house and nowhere to sit in the kitchen. It's really a Japanese house experience.  House was clean and fold out beds comfy. The bathroom is neat with a very deep bath. Toilet upstairs and downstairs, which was handy.

The listing states that luggage drop-off is allowed for guests with late departures, but upon booking, the host informed me that this service was not available, and I would need to use paid luggage storage at a train station. It’s worth noting that the nearest train station at Higashi-Shinjuku only offers storage for carry-on suitcases, not larger ones.

The area around the apartment is clean and quiet yet steps away from all the fun to be had in Nakano. We stayed in  . Apartment is small but has everything you need for your stay. Building is new so the construction material is modern. The stairs to the second floor would not work well if you had mobility issues. Syuka was very kind and helpful. We stayed for a week and really didn't see or hear the other tenants. Nakano is a great neighborhood with tons of restaurants and shopping. There is a grocery store a half block away. I bought an   wagyu steak at the grocery store for $  and cooked up an awesome lunch. You can get to Shinjuku directly in a few minutes if you use the Rapid Chuo line.

Yawen was very kind and caring, like our own mother. <br/>On the first day we arrived, we asked if it was possible to do an early check in since our flight arrived in Japan in the morning. Yawen herself welcomed us to her place and helped us with the luggage. <br/>The place is exactly the same as in the pictures. Clean, spacious and very comfortable. They provided daily laundry service, which really amazed us. It took only   minutes to walk from the nearest train station.   minutes by train to the Shinjuku area.<br/>On the last day of our stay, Yawen came to our place like it was a farewell. She provided a taxi to Haneda the next day when we left Japan. <br/>I highly recommend Yawen’s place to anyone who’d like to have a great stay in Japan. I will definitely come back to her place in the near future when I visit Japan.",en,0.99

There was extra toilet paper provided, but if left in the designated spot in the bathroom, it got soggy due to the moisture from showers and baths. There was only one trash can downstairs even though you’re instructed to separate your trash. Nothing deal-breaking and all of it easily remedied.<br/>The TV channels were limited, but the wifi worked well enough for streaming services.<br/>The area is very peaceful and there are some great grocery stores around if you like to cook.

The beds are comfortable. The TV is a Smart TV, hence you can browse Netflix and Youtube. <br/>- lots of restaurants and convenience stores nearby. <br/>Cons: <br/>- the water heater was not working on the first night. And since there was no staff available  / , it got fixed the next day. We just used an electric kettle to have a hot water for shower. It caused so much inconvenience. <br/>- on our   day, the water stopped running in the bathroom due to weak water pressure. Bathroom is on   floor. <br/>- the apartment is on the  -  floor.

The place is great, clean and spacious. The only downside is it’s a little expensive to only have   bathroom, really challenging when you’re  -  people waiting on each other to finish businesses. The internet connection upstairs was stable but the basement area is impossible to surf with but he tried his best to assist us, but the signal there isn’t just sufficient. Especially for work from location people that needs fast and sustainable internet connection. Maybe it needs a signal booster. The kitchen is very clean and dining area is big enough. The beds are comfortable and linens are clean too. Open spaces are good for families that want to bond together but if you’re too much into privacy, it’s not this place cuz it’s like a loft with beds and no doors. Just open spaces.. but it’s really beautiful and the area you’re in is in the middle of everything.",en,0.9921

They even took videos of us, but I alerted the host about it.

However, due to the room’s shape, it is somewhat impractically furnished, so a lot of space is not optimally utilized and wasted.

For example, we had to heave our   suitcases behind the huge niche behind the bed to move around the room normally. Furthermore, there are some cafes, restaurants, and bakeries around the accommodation, which sounds ideal at first. However, it’s better not to leave the windows open during the day, as all the smells enter the room.<br/>This problem might not exist in the rooms on higher floors.

The concrete wall interior and warm lights makes the place look chic. <br/>This place is highly recommended if you want to get away from tourist areas and explore or experience a different part of Japan.

We walked from Takadanobaba to our homestay after dinner and it was beautiful soaking in the atmosphere. <br/>There is a taiyaki store literally next to the door and a convenient store across the street.

The apartment itself was also very clean and tidy.<br/>The only major downside about the place is that it is fairly tiny. The shower and toilet are really only big enough for a single person to stand/sit in without moving around.<br/>There is also no separate changing area, so when you step out of the shower, you are standing right in front of the kitchen. This may be a concern if you are staying with multiple people, who would have to turn the other way while someone is changing.<br/>In addition, there are no chairs, so you will mostly be standing or lying down.

We were impressed by the fact that the apartment is tiny yet has pretty much everything we need. The space inside was well thought out so we didn't feel cramp even with   people staying. The shower was a little bit tough because it's so small, but that didn't surprise me. Location wise, it's a nice neighborhood, very quiet and peaceful, but a little tough to get to tourist spots. I recommend finding a place closer to train/subway station instead. Every night, it took us about   minutes to walk home from the nearby subway station. This AirBnb was a last minute booking due to a cancellation from another host, so we couldn't be so choosy about location given our budget. It was a very authentic experience staying in a tiny Japanese apartment though. We enjoyed the place a lot during our stay. Oh, minor warning. The mattress is a little bit thin.

Convenience stores, restaurants, cafes are all very accessible with a short walk. The building is very nice. The apartment feels new.<br/>Now, this property, is perfect for   people. It's one regular bed and a floor sofa that opens up to an additional full size bed. When the sofa is open to use as a bed, you can hardly walk in the apartment. This was not a problem for us because it was only me and my spouse. If you are a tall person it can get interesting in the shower. I am   feet tall and was reasonably ok. Any taller than that and your shower will be an adventure. It is a small Japanese shower.

It represents so much possibility in such a little space. The interior design and furnitures are salvaged and carpentry DIY. When we first arrived, I had to adjust to its compactness.

The breakfasts are sourced from the proprietress’ farm in Saitama and Tsukiji Market. Fuko told us, and showed us, how she—with her co-hosts—renovated the derelict old house into this fine establishment. There are only three rooms, ensuring intimate stay experience. The atmosphere in general seems to filter the staying guests. Our “housemates” were pleasant and amiable. The location is strategic, a bit hidden but near metro station.

Really cool walk to Asakusa through a park with a small river, I really recommend that. A lot of shops,  playgrounds and restaurants nearby. The house is comfortable, we were   (two adults and two kids) and it was still comfortable. I guess because the host is a company they aren't really generous.

I was easily able to walk to many popular tourist attractions, explore local shops and cafes, and immerse myself in the city's atmosphere.<br/>Over all, I highly recommend this airbnb property if you want to stay in the center of Tokyo with a reasonable price.",en,0.9831

Playgrounds and schools nearby, it’s a real taste of local Japanese’s daily life instead of those touristic places.<br/>Accessibility to   train stations, with McDonald’s, convenient stores and all the local shops, just   stops away from Asakusa too. There’s so much to explore in the neighbourhood, to live like a local.<br/>We were just too tired and rushing everyday to spend enough time to enjoy the home.

The neighbourhood is curiously quiet and the house is literally brand-new! Everything inside is super clean then; it felt like we hit the jack pot. Thanks Keita! We were a family of six and it was the perfect base for us. You can get anywhere from here in minutes (more on that later). The host is so soo friendly, and the listing description doesn’t overexaggerate when it says there is literally everything you could need in the surrounding area. Minutes on foot, you have everything! Food, groceries, medicine, clothes, et cetera. Also loads of cool traditional stuff and treats. Shinjuku station is just a few minutes away by direct train and one stop. Which is insane when you think about it. I’d say this is better than Shinjuku though as that place and station is soooo confusing at times. So I recommend booking this Bnb early to get in there before someone else takes it!

The rooms themselves are very clean and a lot of amenities are provided by the host which is very good. The train station takes around   mins by foot so it takes quite a while to go there. Overall the place is very good and would recommend to anyone who wants the quieter side of Tokyo. Also the host is super friendly and super fast in responding which is very good! :)",en,0.9865
